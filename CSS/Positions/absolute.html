        <h2>position: absolute;</h2>

        <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest
        positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

        <p>However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses 
            the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>

        <strong>A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.</strong>

        <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
        <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
</div>
